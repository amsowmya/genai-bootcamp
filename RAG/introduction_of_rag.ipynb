Prompt: Multi-agent collaboration system.What We Will CoverWhat are agents? A deeper look at how we define agents and what sets them apart from AI pipelines, and standalone LLMs.Hands-on example built using 3 popular agent frameworks: LangGraph, CrewAI, and OpenAI Swarm (full code).Our recommendation on when to use which framework.What to expect next: A preview of Part II, where we’ll explore debuggability and observability in these frameworks.IntroductionAutonomous agents powered by LLMs have seen their ups and downs. From the viral demos of AutoGPT and BabyAGI in 2023 to today’s more refined frameworks, the concept of agents-LLMs that can execute end-to-end tasks autonomously-has captured both imagination and skepticism.Why the renewed interest? LLMs have seen significant upgrades over the past 9 months: longer context windows, structured outputs, better reasoning, and simple tool integration. These advancements make building reliable agentic applications more viable than ever.In this blog, we’ll explore three popular frameworks for building agentic applications: LangGraph, CrewAI, and OpenAI Swarm. By using a hands-on example of an Agentic Finance Assistant, we’ll highlight each framework’s strengths, weaknesses, and practical use cases.What are agents?Agents are advanced systems powered by large language models (LLMs) that can independently interact with their environment and make decisions in real time. Unlike traditional LLM applications, which are structured as rigid, predefined pipelines (e.g., A → B → C), agentic workflows introduce a dynamic and adaptive approach. Agents leverage tools -functions or APIs that enable interaction with their environment-to decide their next steps based on context and goals. This flexibility allows agents to deviate from fixed sequences, enabling more autonomous and efficient workflows tailored to complex and evolving tasks.However, this flexibility comes with its own set of challenges:Managing state and memory across tasksOrchestrating multiple sub-agents and their communication schema.Making sure the tool calling is reliable and handling complex error cases when they arise.Handling reasoning and decision-making at scale.Why we need Agent FrameworksBuilding agents from scratch is no small feat. Frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and OpenAI Swarm simplify the process, enabling developers to focus on their application logic instead of reinventing the wheel for state management, orchestration, and tool integration.At their core agents framework offerA simple way to define agents and toolsAn orchestration mechanismState managementAdditional tools to enable more complex applications like: persistence layer (memory), interruptions, etcWe will go through each of these in the following sections.\\u200dIntroducing Agent FrameworksWe chose LangGraph, CrewAI, and OpenAI Swarm because they represent the latest schools of thought in agent development. Here’s a quick overview:LangGraph: As its name suggests, LangGraph bets on graph architecture as the best way to define and orchestrate agentic workflows. Unlike early versions of LangChain, LangGraph is a well designed framework with many robust and customizable features built for production. However, it’s sometimes more complex than necessary for certain use cases and can create additional overhead.CrewAI: CrewAI in contrast is much simpler to get started. It comes with intuitive abstractions that help you focus on task design as opposed to writing complex orchestration and state management logic. However, the tradeoff is that it is a highly opinionated framework and is more difficult to customize down the road.OpenAI Swarm: A lightweight, minimalist framework described by OpenAI to be “educational” rather than “production-ready”. OpenAI Swarm almost represents an “anti-framework” — leaving many functionalities up to developers to implement or for the powerful LLMs to figure out themselves. We believe it could be the perfect fit for those with simple use cases today, or for those who want to integrate nimble agentic workflows into an existing LLM pipeline.\\u200dGithub star history comparison as of November 2024.Other Notable FrameworksLlamaIndex Workflow: An event-driven framework that is a conceptually good fit for many agentic workflows. However, as it stands today, we find that it still requires the developers to write a significant amount of boilerplate code to make it work. The LlamaIndex team is actively improving the Workflow framework and we hope they create more high-level abstractions soon.AutoGen: A framework developed by Microsoft for multi-agent conversation orchestration, AutoGen has been adopted for a variety of agent use cases. Learning from the mistakes and feedback from the early versions, AutoGen team is doing a complete rewrite (from v0.2 to v0.4) into an event-driven orchestration framework.Building an Agentic Finance AssistantTo benchmark these frameworks, we built the same agentic finance assistant using each framework. Full code for the applications built are available here: Relari Agent Examples.We want the agent to handle complex queries like:How does Spirit Airline’s financial health compare to its competitors?What is Apple’s best performing product line from the financial perspective? And what are they marketing on their website?Find me some consumer stocks that are below $5bn in market cap that has a revenue growth over 20% YoYHere’s an example snippet of the comprehensive response we’d like to see from assistant:Image by Relari: Example response snapshot from the Agentic Finance AssistantTo accomplish these, we provide the agent system access to a financial database through the FMP API and internet access to research internet content.When building an agentic AI application, one of the first choices we need to take is the architecture. There are several architectures and each of them has their pros and cons. In the image below there are some popular architecture summarized by LangGraph (You can read more about the architectural choices here: multi-agent architecture).Image by LangChain: multi-agent-architectureWe picked the Supervisor architecture for this application for educational purposes. So we will be creating a Supervisor Agent whose task is to decide which sub-agent to delegate the task, and three sub-agents with tool access: a financial data agent, a web research agent, and a summarizing agent.Image by Relari. Agentic Finance Assistant architecture.Let’s explore how each framework approaches agent creation, tool integration, orchestration, memory, and human-in-the-loop interaction.\\u200d1. Defining Agents and ToolsWe first look at how we define a regular agent like Financial Data Agent, Web Research Agent and Output Summarizing Agent and declare its associated tools in each framework. The Supervisor Agent is a special agent that plays the orchestration role so we will cover in the Orchestration section.LangGraphThe easiest way to create a simple tool-calling agent is to use the prebuilt create_react_agent function as below, where we can provide the tools and prompts we want this agent to operate with.from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agentfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIfrom langchain_core.tools import tool# Below is one example of a tool definition@tooldef get_stock_price(symbol: str) -> dict:    \"\"\"Fetch the current stock price for a given symbol.    Args:        symbol (str): The stock ticker symbol (e.g., \"AAPL\" for Apple Inc.).    Returns:        dict: A dictionary containing the stock price or an error message.    \"\"\"    base_url = \"https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/quote-short\"    params = {\"symbol\": symbol, \"apikey\": os.getenv(\"FMP_API_KEY\")}    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)    if response.status_code == 200:        data = response.json()        if data:            return {\"price\": data[0][\"price\"]}    return {\"error\": \"Unable to fetch stock price.\"}# Below is one example of a simple react agentfinancial_data_agent = create_react_agent(    ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\"),    tools=[get_stock_price, get_company_profile, ...],    state_modifier=\"You are a financial data agent responsible for retrieving financial data using the provided API tools ...\",)In LangGraph, everything is structured as a graph. The utility function create_react_agent creates a simple executable graph that contains the agent node and the tool node.Image by Relari. Graph of a simple tool-calling react agent.The agent acts as the decision maker and dynamically determines which tools to call and assesses whether it has sufficient information to transition to the __end__ state.In the graphs, solid lines represent deterministic edges (the Tool node must always return to the agent), whereas dashed lines represent conditional edges where the LLM-powered agent is making the decisions on where to go next.Nodes and edges are foundational building blocks of the graph. We will see later in the orchestration section that this graph can be represented as a node in a larger, more complex graph.\\u200dCrewAICrewAI’s agent definition centers around the relationship between agents and tasks (what the agent is supposed to accomplish).With each agent, we must define its role, goal, and backstory, and specify the tools it has access to.from crewai import Agent, Taskfinancial_data_agent = Agent(    role=\"Financial Data Agent\",    goal=\"Retrieve comprehensive financial data using FMP API that provide the data needed to answer the user\\'s query\",    backstory=\"\"\"You\\'re a seasoned financial data gatherer with extensive experience in    gathering financial information. Known for your precision    and ability to find the most relevant financial data points using    FMP API that provides financial data on public companies in the US\"\"\",    tools=[        StockPriceTool(),        CompanyProfileTool(),        ...    ])Then we have to create the task that requires the agent to execute. The Task must contain the description and the expected_output.gather_financial_data = Task(    description=(\"Conduct thorough financial research to gather relevant financial data that can help \"    \"answer the user query: {query}. Use the available financial tools to fetch accurate \"    \"and up-to-date information. Focus on finding relevant stock prices, company profiles, \"    \"financial ratios, and other pertinent financial metrics that answer the user\\'s query: {query}.\"),    expected_output=\"A comprehensive set of financial data points that directly address the query: {query}.\",    agent=financial_data_agent,)This structured approach to building prompts for LLMs provides a clear and consistent framework, ensuring that agents and tasks are well-defined. While this method helps maintain focus and coherence, it can sometimes feel rigid or repetitive, particularly when repeatedly defining roles, goals, backstories, and task descriptions.Tools can be integrated using the @tool decorator, similar to the approach in LangGraph. It is worth mentioning that alternatively, we could extend the BaseTool class, which would be a more robust method for enforcing tool input schemas, thanks to the use of Pydantic models (this approach is also supported by LangGraph).class StockPriceInput(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Input schema for stock price queries.\"\"\"    symbol: str = Field(..., description=\"The stock ticker symbol\")class StockPriceTool(BaseTool):    name: str = \"Get Stock Price\"    description: str = \"Fetch the current stock price for a given symbol\"    args_schema: Type[BaseModel] = StockPriceInputdef _run(self, symbol: str) -> dict:    # Use FMP API to fetch the stock price of the given symbol\\u200dOpenAI SwarmSwarm takes a different approach: instead of explicitly defining the reasoning flow in code, OpenAI proposes to structure the flow in system prompts as “Routines” (in instructions), predefined sets of steps or instructions that an agent follows to accomplish a task. This is understandable coming from OpenAI as they would prefer developers to lean more on the models ability of following instructions rather than defining sets of custom logic in code. We find this approach to be simple and effective when working with a stronger LLM that\\'s capable of keeping track of an reasoning over the Routines.For tools, we can just bring in directly as tools.from swarm import Agentfinancial_data_agent = Agent(    name=\"Financial Data Agent\",    instructions=\"\"\"You are a financial data specialist responsible for retrieving financial data using the provided API tools.    Your tasks:    Step 1. Given a user query, use the appropriate tool to fetch relevant financial data    Step 2. Read the data and make sure they can answer the user query. If not, modify the tool input or use different tools to get more information.    Step 3. Once you have gathered enough information, return only the raw data obtained from the tool. Do not add commentary or explanations\"\"\",    functions=[        get_stock_price,        get_company_profile,        ...    ])\\u200d2. OrchestrationWe now look at the core part of each framework on how they bring multiple sub-agents together.\\u200dLangGraphThe core of langgraph is graph-based orchestration. We first create the supervisor agent, which acts as a router and its sole task is to analyze the situation and decide which agent to call next. The execution agents themselves can only communicate the results back to the supervisor agent.LangGraph requires the explicit definition of the state. The AgentState class helps define a common state schema across different agents.class AgentState(TypedDict):    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]    next: strFor each agent, we interact with the state by wrapping it in a node that converts the agent output into the consistent message schema.async def financial_data_node(state):    result = await financial_data_agent.ainvoke(state)    return {        \"messages\": [            AIMessage(                content=result[\"messages\"][-1].content, name=\"Financial_Data_Agent\"            )        ]    }We are now ready to define the agent itself.class RouteResponse(BaseModel):    next: Literal[OPTIONS]def supervisor_agent(state):    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([        (\"system\", ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT),        MessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),        (            \"system\",            \"Given the conversation above, who should act next?\"            \" Or should we FINISH? Select one of: {options}\",        ),    ]).partial(options=str(OPTIONS), members=\", \".join(MEMBERS))      supervisor_chain = prompt | LLM.with_structured_output(RouteResponse)    return supervisor_chain.invoke(state)After defining the supervisor agent, we define the agent workflow as a graph by adding each agent as a node and all the execution logic as edges.When defining the edges we have two possibilities: regular or conditional edges. Regular edges are used when we want a deterministic transition. For example, the Financial Data Agent should always return the results to the Supervisor_Agent to decide the next steps.Conditional edges instead are used when we want the LLM to pick which path to take (e.g. the Supervisor Agent deciding if it has enough data to just send to the Output Summerizing Agent or go back to the Data and Web agents for more information.from langgraph.graph import END, START, StateGraphdef build_workflow() -> StateGraph:    \"\"\"Construct the state graph for the workflow.\"\"\"    workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)    workflow.add_node(\"Supervisor_Agent\", supervisor_agent)    workflow.add_node(\"Financial_Data_Agent\", financial_data_node)    workflow.add_node(\"Web_Research_Agent\", web_research_node)    workflow.add_node(\"Output_Summarizing_Agent\", output_summarizing_node)    workflow.add_edge(\"Financial_Data_Agent\", \"Supervisor_Agent\")    workflow.add_edge(\"Web_Research_Agent\", \"Supervisor_Agent\")    conditional_map = {        \"Financial_Data_Agent\": \"Financial_Data_Agent\",        \"Web_Research_Agent\": \"Web_Research_Agent\",        \"Output_Summarizing_Agent\": \"Output_Summarizing_Agent\",        \"FINISH\": \"Output_Summarizing_Agent\",    }    workflow.add_conditional_edges(        \"Supervisor_Agent\", lambda x: x[\"next\"], conditional_map    )    workflow.add_edge(\"Output_Summarizing_Agent\", END)    workflow.add_edge(START, \"Supervisor_Agent\")    return workflowHere is the resulting graph.Image by Relari. Graph of the Agentic Finance Assistant.CrewAIIn contrast to LangGraph, CrewAI abstracts away most of the orchestration tasks.supervisor_agent = Agent(    role=\"Financial Assistant Manager\",    goal=\"Leverage the skills of your coworkers to answer the user\\'s query: {query}.\",    backstory=\"\"\"You are a manager who oversees the workflow of the financial assistant,    skilled in overseeing complex workers with different skills and ensuring that you can answer the user\\'s query with the help of the coworkers.    You always try to gather data using the financial data agent and / or web scraping agent first.    After gathering the data, you must delegate to the output summarizing agent to create a comprehensive report instead of answering the user\\'s query directly.\"\"\",    verbose=True,    llm=ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o\", temperature=0.5),    allow_delegation=True,    )Similar to Langgraph, we first create the supervisor agent. Notice the allow_delegation flag which allows the agent to pass tasks to other agents.Next we use the Crew to bring the agents together. It\\'s important to select Process.hierarchical here to allow the supervisor agent to delegate tasks. Behind the scenes, the supervisor agent takes the user query and converts it into tasks, it then finds the associated agents to carry out those tasks. The alternative is to not use a manager agent and do Process.sequential if we want to create a more deterministic process where tasks will be executed sequentially.finance_crew = Crew(    agents=[        financial_data_agent,        web_scraping_agent,        output_summarizing_agent    ],    tasks=[        gather_financial_data,        gather_website_information,        summarize_findings    ],    process=Process.hierarchical,    manager_agent=supervisor_agent,)\\u200dOpenAI SwarmSwarm orchestration uses a very simple strategy — handoffs. The core idea is to create a transfer function where it uses another agent as a tool.This is undoubtedly the cleanest approach. The relationships are implicit in the transfer functions.def transfer_to_summarizer():    return summarizing_agentdef transfer_to_web_researcher():    return web_researcher_agentdef transfer_to_financial_data_agent():    return financial_data_agentsupervisor_agent = Agent(    name=\"Supervisor\",    instructions=\"\"\"You are a supervisor agent responsible for coordinating the Financial Data Agent, Web Researcher Agent, and Summarizing Agent.    Your tasks:    1. Given a user query, determine which agent to delegate the task to based on the user\\'s query    2. If the user\\'s query requires financial data, delegate to the Financial Data Agent    3. If the user\\'s query requires web research, delegate to the Web Researcher Agent    4. If there\\'s enough information already available to answer the user\\'s query, delegate to the Summarizing Agent for final output.    Never summarize the data yourself. Always delegate to the Summarizing Agent to provide the final output.    \"\"\",    functions=[ # Agent as a tool        transfer_to_financial_data_agent,        transfer_to_web_researcher,        transfer_to_summarizer    ])A drawback of this approach is that as the application grows the dependencies between agents are harder to keep track of.3. MemoryMemory is a critical component of a stateful agentic system. We can distinguish two layers of memory:short-term memory allows an agent to maintain multi-turn / multi-step executions,long-term memory allows an agent to learn and remember preferences across sessions.This topic can get very complex, but let’s take a look at the simplest memory orchestration available in each framework.\\u200dLangGraphLangGraph differentiates memory between in-thread (memory within a single conversation thread) and cross-thread (memory across conversation).To save in-thread memory, LangGraph offers the MemorySaver() class that saves the state of the graph, or the conversation history into a checkpointer.from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaverdef build_app():    \"\"\"Build and compile the workflow.\"\"\"    memory = MemorySaver()    workflow = build_workflow()    return workflow.compile(checkpointer=memory)To associate an agent execution with a memory thread, pass a configuration with a thread_id. This tells the agent which thread\\'s memory checkpointer to use. For example:config = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}app = build_app()await run(app, input, config)To save cross-thread memory, LangGraph allows us to save memory to a JSON Document Storage.from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStorestore = InMemoryStore()  # Can be a DB-backed store in production useuser_id = \"user_0\"store.put(    user_id,    \"current_portfolio\",    {        \"portfolio\": [\"TSLA\", \"AAPL\", \"GOOG\"],    })\\u200dCrewAINot surprisingly, CrewAI takes a simpler, but more rigid approach. All that’s required on the developer side is to set memory to true.finance_crew = Crew(    agents=[financial_data_agent, web_researcher_agent, summarizing_agent],    tasks=[gather_financial_data, gather_website_information, summarize_findings],    process=Process.hierarchical,    manager_agent=supervisor_agent,    memory=True, # creates memory databases in \"CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR\" folder    verbose=True, # necessary for memory)What it does behind the scene is very complex, as it creates a few different memory storage:Short-term memory: it creates a ChromaDB vectorstore with OpenAI Embeddings that stores the agent execution history.Most recent memory: SQLite3 db to store the most recent task execution results.Long-term memory: SQLite3 db to store task results, note that the task description has to match exactly (fairly strict) for a long term memory to be retrievedEntity memory: extracts key entities and stores the entity relationship into another ChromaDB vectorstore.Image by Relari. Different memory storage databases automatically generated by CrewAI.OpenAI SwarmSwarm uses a simple stateless design and doesn’t have any built-in memory features. One reference for how OpenAI thinks about memory can be seen in its stateful Assistant API. Each conversation has a thread_id for short term memory, whereas each assistant has an assistant_id that can be associated with long term memory.It’s also possible to integrate third party memory layer providers such as mem0 or implement our own short-term and long-term.4. Human-in-the-loopAlthough we want the agent to be autonomous, many agents are designed to interact with humans.For example, a customer support agent can be asking the user for information throughout the execution chain. Humans can also act as auditors or guides to enable more seamless human-agent collaboration.\\u200dLangGraphLangGraph allows us to set breakpoint in the graph, like below if we want to add a human checkpoint before the summarizer builds the final output.workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer, interrupt_before=[\"Output_Summarizing_Agent\"])The Graph will then execute until the break point is reached. We can then implement a step to get the user input before proceeding with the graph.# Run the graph until the first interruptionfor event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode=\"values\"):    print(event)try:    user_approval = input(\"Do you want to go to Output Summarizer? (yes/no): \")except:    user_approval = \"yes\"if user_approval.lower() == \"yes\":    # If approved, continue the graph execution    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode=\"values\"):        print(event)else:    print(\"Operation canceled by user.\")\\u200dCrewAICrewAI allows humans to provide feedback to an agent by just setting human_input=True flag in the agent initialization.Image by Relari. Message generated by CrewAI to ask for human input.The agent will then pause after executing and ask the user to input natural language feedback on its actions and results (see below).However, it doesn’t support more custom human-in-the-loop interactions.\\u200dOpenAI SwarmSwarm doesn’t have any built-in human-in-the-loop functions. However, the simplest way to add human input in the middle of the execution is to add human as a Tool or as an agent that the AI agents can transfer to.\\u200dSummary of feature differencesTo summarize our findings building the same application across the three frameworks.Image by Relari. Feature comparison summary.\\u200dOur RecommendationWe summarized our recommendation in the flowchart to help you navigate your decision on which framework to start with.Image by Relari.

      "A complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\n",
      "Task Decomposition#\n",
      "Chain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\n",
      "Tree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\n",
      "Task decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\n",
      "Another quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\n",
      "Self-Reflection#\n",

      "Reflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\n",

      "The heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\n",
      "Self-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\n",

      "Chain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\geq r_{n-1} \\geq \\dots \\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\leq i \\leq j \\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\n",
      "To avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\n",

      "Fig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\n",
      "The idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\n",
      "The paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\n",
      "In reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\n",
      "In comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\n",

      "Types of Memory#\n",
      "Memory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\n",
      "\n",
      "Explicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\n",

      "\n",
      "Fig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\n",
      "We can roughly consider the following mappings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\n",
      "Short-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\n",
      "Long-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\n",
      "The external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)​ algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\n",
      "A couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\n",
      "\n",
      "LSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\n",
      "ANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\n",
      "HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\n",
      "FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\n",
      "ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\langle q, x_i \\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\angle q, \\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\n",

A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\n",
      "They did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\n",

The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id.

The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more.

      "After going through key ideas and demos of building LLM-centered agents, I start to see a couple common limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finite context length: The restricted context capacity limits the inclusion of historical information, detailed instructions, API call context, and responses. The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Reliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\n",

(Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.')]"
